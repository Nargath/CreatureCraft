# CreatureCraft
This is my repo and collected information on my work-in-progress interconnected subsystem system called "Creature Craft"

This maps the process of acquiring, and using, components known as Essences to create and enhance other items and abilities.

So far it consists of:
- Hindercraft
- Harvestcraft
- Distillcraft
- Forgecraft
- Cookcraft

Future subsystems will include:
- Distillcraft
- Brewcraft

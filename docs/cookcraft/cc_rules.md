## What Is CookCraft?

CookCraft transforms harvested creature components into temporary consumables. Unlike permanent crafting or complex alchemy, CookCraft provides short-term benefits that support adventure activities through simple cooking mechanics.

**Key Benefits:**

- Convert creature materials into beneficial consumables
- Recipe categories determine how tag powers manifest
- Prepare for adventures with environmental protection, performance boosts, and special capabilities
- Create economic value from harvested materials

**No Recipe Requirements:**
Anyone can cook creature components - there are no recipes to learn or discover. The knowledge is simply choosing which category effect you want from your component. A [Fire] component can provide fire protection (Sustenance), improved reflexes (Enhancement), or ignition capability (Utility) based on how you prepare it.

## Core Mechanics

### Basic Process

1. **Choose Recipe:** Select category and food form
2. **Gather Components:** One special + appropriate mundane components
3. **Make Check:** Roll Survival or Crafting vs DC
4. **Cook Time:** 30 minutes (field) or 1 hour (camp)
5. **Results:** Create consumables based on success

### Difficulty Class
**DC = 14 + Tag Level**

- **Tag Level:** From the special component used (0 for mundane-only)
- **Batch Cooking:** +2 DC per additional serving beyond the first

### Skills
**Choose based on approach:**

- **Survival:** Traditional cooking, field preparation, natural methods
- **Crafting:** Technical precision, equipment usage, refined techniques

### Degrees of Success

**Critical Success:** Create 2 servings
**Success:** Create 1 serving
**Failure:** Components consumed, no result
**Critical Failure:** Components destroyed + Sickened 1 for 1 hour

---

## Duration and Effect Scaling

### Core Principle
**Effect magnitude is fixed by recipe category.** Higher tag levels provide longer duration, not stronger effects.

### Duration by Category
**Base duration multiplied by tag level:**

- **Sustenance:** 1 hour x tag level (max 24 hours)
- **Enhancement:** 30 minutes x tag level (max 10 hours)
- **Utility:** 30 minutes x tag level (max 10 hours)

### Examples

**[Fire 5] Sustenance:** Fire resistance 5 for 5 hours
**[Fire 12] Enhancement:** +2 Reflex saves for 360 minutes (6 hours)
**[Flight 8] Utility:** 20-foot fly speed for 240 minutes (4 hours)

## How CookCraft Works

### The Simple Truth
**[Special Component] + [Mundane Components] + [Category] = Effect**

There are no complex recipes to learn. If you have a [Fire] component and some meat, you can cook it. The category you choose (Sustenance, Enhancement, Utility) determines what benefit you get from that [Fire] essence.

### Core Rules

**One Component, One Effect:**

- Each recipe uses ONE special component
- Adding more special components doesn't enhance the effect
- Save extra components for additional meals

### Batch Cooking by Category

**Utility Recipes:** 

- Always single-serving
- Special capabilities are personal (can't share fly speed or invisibility)
- Perfect for using low-level components

**Enhancement/Sustenance Recipes:**

- Can split duration among multiple servings
- Example: [Fire 12] Enhancement = 120 min solo OR 40 min for 3 people
- DC increases by +2 per additional serving

### What Doesn't Work

- [Fire 5] + [Fire 5] &rarr; [Fire 10] effect
- [Fire 5] + [Sharp 3] &rarr; both effects at once
- Multiple components don't stack or enhance

---

## Recipe Categories

Recipe categories are simply different ways to prepare components. The same [Fire] component can be cooked three different ways, each extracting a different benefit from its essence:

### Sustenance
*Slow-cooked for lasting nourishment*

**Tag Interpretations (Fixed Effects):**

- **[Fire]** &rarr; Fire resistance 5
- **[Cold]** &rarr; Cold resistance 5
- **[Acid]** &rarr; Acid resistance 5
- **[Lightning]** &rarr; Lightning resistance 5
- **[Sonic]** &rarr; Sonic resistance 5
- **[Venom]** &rarr; Poison resistance 5
- **[Vision]** &rarr; Reduce light/dark penalties by 1 step
- **[Sense]** &rarr; Sentinel Awareness (secret check after 10 min)
- **[Regeneration]** &rarr; Remove wounded (1 min after combat)
- **[Mundane]** &rarr; Basic nutrition and fatigue removal

**Duration:** 1 hour x tag level (max 24 hours)
**Example:** [Fire 5] Sustenance = Fire resistance 5 for 5 hours

### Enhancement  
*Prepared to boost abilities*

**Tag Interpretations (Fixed Effects):**

- **[Fire]** &rarr; +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves
- **[Cold]** &rarr; +1 status bonus to AC
- **[Acid]** &rarr; +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves
- **[Lightning]** &rarr; +1 status bonus to Initiative
- **[Sonic]** &rarr; +2 circumstance bonus to Performance & Intimidation
- **[Venom]** &rarr; +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves vs poison
- **[Sharp]** &rarr; +1 item bonus to attack rolls
- **[Vision]** &rarr; +2 circumstance bonus to Perception (visual)
- **[Flight]** &rarr; +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics
- **[Magical]** &rarr; +1 circumstance bonus to spell DCs & attacks

**Duration:** 30 minutes x tag level (max 10 hours)
**Example:** [Sharp 8] Enhancement = +1 to attacks for 240 minutes (4 hours)

### Utility
*Prepared to grant special capabilities*

**Tag Interpretations (Fixed Effects):**

- **[Fire]** &rarr; Ignite (light fires, melt wax, heat objects)
- **[Flight]** &rarr; Gain 20-foot fly speed (hover)
- **[Vision]** &rarr; See invisibility
- **[Water]** &rarr; Breathe underwater
- **[Burrow]** &rarr; Gain 15-foot burrow speed through earth
- **[Sharp]** &rarr; Ignore object Hardness up to 5 (non-magical objects)
- **[Magical]** &rarr; Read magic (understand magical writing)
- **[Venom]** &rarr; Create contact poison (2d4 damage, Fort DC 10+level)
- **[Charm]** &rarr; Sustained Charm (1 min setup, maintain conversation)

**Duration:** 30 minutes x tag level (max 10 hours)
**Example:** [Flight 6] Utility = 20-foot fly speed for 180 minutes

**Note:** Not every tag has a natural Utility application - some components are better suited for Sustenance or Enhancement.

## Component Requirements

### The Basic Formula
**Every recipe = [Special Component] + [Mundane Components] + [Category Choice]**

- Special component provides the tagged power
- Mundane components make it edible food
- Category choice determines how the power manifests

### Special Components

- **One per recipe:** Each recipe uses exactly ONE special component
- **No stacking:** Additional components don't enhance effects
- **Batch cooking:** Enhancement/Sustenance can split duration among servings
- **Utility restriction:** Utility recipes are always single-serving (special capabilities cannot be shared)
- **Tag mixing:** Cannot mix different special tag types in one recipe

### Mundane Components & Food Forms
The mundane components you use determine what type of food you make. All forms provide the same mechanical effect but create different narrative experiences:

**Stew/Soup:** [Meat] + [Fat] + [Bone] or [Organs]

- Natural choice for batch cooking
- Camp cooking only (needs pot and time)

**Roast/Grilled:** [Meat] + [Fat]

- Simple and reliable
- Can be field-cooked

**Jerky/Preserved:** [Meat] only

- Takes longer to prepare
- Travels well, good for Sustenance

**Broth/Tonic:** [Bone] + [Organs] or [Blood]

- Light and quick to consume

**Pie/Pastry:** [Meat] + [Fat] + trade goods (flour, etc.)

- Requires civilization supplies
- Impressive for social situations

### Batch Cooking Requirements

- Add 1 mundane component per extra serving
- Example: Stew for 3 people needs 3Ãƒâ€” the mundane components

---

## Time and Equipment

### Cooking Time
**Field Cooking:** 30 minutes

- Quick preparations over open flame
- Limited to simpler food forms (roasts, jerky)
- Requires portable cooking kit

**Camp Cooking:** 1 hour

- Full meal preparation with proper setup
- Enables all food forms (stews, soups, pies)
- Better for batch cooking

### Equipment
**Portable Cooking Kit** (5 gp, 3 Bulk)

- Basic pots, utensils, portable heat source
- No penalty to checks
- Enables field cooking

**Professional Cooking Tools** (25 gp, 5 Bulk)

- Quality cookware, precision utensils, spices
- +1 item bonus to CookCraft checks
- Makes field cooking more versatile

### Food Form Limitations
Some food forms require specific conditions:

- **Stews/Soups:** Need camp setup and proper pots
- **Pies/Pastries:** Require trade goods (flour, etc.)
- **Jerky:** Takes longer but can be done while traveling
- **Roasts:** Can be field-cooked with basic equipment

## Effect Guidelines

### Fixed Effect Magnitudes

Effects are determined by recipe category, NOT tag level:
- All elemental damage Sustenance recipes ([Fire], [Cold], [Acid], [Lightning], [Sonic]) give resistance 5
- All [Fire] Enhancement recipes give +10 movement speed
- All [Flight] Utility recipes give 20-foot fly speed
- Higher tag levels provide longer duration, not stronger effects

### Stacking Rules

- Same recipe type doesn't stack (higher bonus applies)
- Different categories stack normally (Enhancement + Utility + Sustenance)
- Cannot consume same recipe until duration expires
- All effects provide item bonuses (following PF2e item bonus rules)

## Example Recipes

*Note: Recipe names are purely narrative. "Drake Fire Roast" is mechanically identical to "Goblin Fire Stew" if both use [Fire] components of the same level.*

### Wolf Pack Jerky

- **Category:** Sustenance
- **Food Form:** Jerky ([Meat] only)
- **Components:** [Meat] x1
- **DC:** 14 (no special component)
- **Effect:** Removes fatigued, provides 8 hours satiation
- **Note:** Simple trail food using only mundane ingredients

### Drake Fire Roast

- **Category:** Enhancement  
- **Food Form:** Roast ([Meat] + [Fat])
- **Components:** [Fire 7] + drake [Meat] + drake [Fat]
- **DC:** 21 (14 + 7)
- **Effect:** +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves for 210 minutes (3.5 hours)

### Harpy Wing Stew

- **Category:** Utility
- **Food Form:** Stew ([Meat] + [Fat] + [Bone])
- **Components:** [Flight 6] + harpy [Meat] + harpy [Fat] + harpy [Bone]
- **DC:** 20 (14 + 6)
- **Effect:** Gain 20-foot fly speed for 180 minutes (3 hours)


**Note:** Single serving only (Utility recipes don't batch - can't share fly speed)

### Party Protection Soup (Batch)

- **Category:** Sustenance
- **Food Form:** Soup ([Meat] + [Fat] + [Bone])
- **Components:** [Fire 18] + [Meat] x3 + [Fat] x3 + [Bone] x3
- **DC:** 36 (14 + 18 + 4 for 2 extra servings)
- - **Effect:** 3 servings, each person gets Fire Resistance 5 for 6 hours
**Note:** Single component split among 3 people (18 hours / 3 = 6 hours each)

## Dangerous Components

Some tags require careful handling:

**[Fire/Lightning]:** Failure = 1d6 energy damage
**[Venom]:** Failure = Sickened 1 (blocks further cooking)
**[Magical]:** Failure = Stupefied 1 for 10 minutes

Professional tools reduce failure consequences by one step.

## Quick Reference

### Recipe Planning

1. **Choose category** (determines effect type)
2. **Select special component** (determines tag and duration)
3. **Choose food form** (based on available mundane components)
4. **Decide portions** (single or batch for Enhancement/Sustenance)
5. **Calculate DC** (14 + tag level + batch modifier if applicable)
6. **Cook** (30 min field, 1 hour camp)

### Duration Formula

- **Sustenance:** 1 hour x tag level (max 24 hours)
- **Enhancement:** 30 minutes x tag level (max 10 hours)
- **Utility:** 30 minutes x tag level (max 10 hours)

### Batch Cooking

- **Utility:** No batching - always single serving (special capabilities cannot be shared)
- **Enhancement/Sustenance:** Can split duration among servings
- **DC Calculation:** Base DC + 2 per extra serving
- **Duration Split:** Total duration / servings = time per person
- **Important:** Cannot combine multiple special components for enhanced effects

---

**Remember:** CookCraft is simple - one component, one effect. Choose your category to determine how the component's power manifests. Utility recipes are personal capabilities (no batching), while Enhancement and Sustenance can be shared meals (split duration). The mundane components you use determine the food form (stew, roast, jerky) but not the mechanical effect. This system turns leftover creature parts into meaningful tactical choices without complex rules.

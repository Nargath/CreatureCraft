## What Is HarvestCraft?

HarvestCraft allows you to extract valuable materials from defeated creatures. These materials can be used for crafting, cooking, and trade. The system uses the universal Tag framework, meaning components work consistently across all subsystems.

**Key Benefits:**
- Convert defeated creatures into crafting materials
- Acquire tagged components for enhanced crafting
- Gather mundane materials for survival and trade
- Integrate with combat tactics through Hindercraft

## Basic Harvesting

### How to Harvest
**Declare Intent:** Choose what type of component you want to extract
**Make Check:** Roll Survival against the component's DC
**Apply Results:** Gain materials based on your degree of success

### Difficulty Class
**DC = 14 + Tag Level + Difficulty Modifier**
- **Tag Level:** Equals the creature's Challenge Rating
- **Difficulty Modifier:** Based on extraction complexity (+0 to +10)

### Degrees of Success
**Critical Success:** Gain 2 components of the chosen type
**Success:** Gain 1 component of the chosen type  
**Failure:** Gain 0 components + condition that blocks further harvesting (component remains intact)
**Critical Failure:** Gain 0 components + condition that blocks harvesting + component permanently destroyed

### Failure Consequences
Each component type has specific conditions that represent extraction dangers:

**[Fire] Components:** Take 1d6 fire damage - *"You cannot attempt Harvest actions while injured by fire damage"*
**[Venom] Components:** Gain Sickened 1 - *"You cannot attempt Harvest actions while Sickened from venom"*  
**[Sharp] Components:** Gain Clumsy 1 for 10 minutes - *"You cannot attempt Harvest actions while Clumsy from injury"*
**[Magical] Components:** Gain Stupefied 1 for 10 minutes - *"You cannot attempt Harvest actions while Stupefied"*
**[Sensory] Components:** Gain Dazzled for 10 minutes - *"You cannot attempt Harvest actions while Dazzled"*
**[Flight] Components:** Gain Prone + Clumsy 1 for 1 minute - *"You cannot attempt Harvest actions while Clumsy"*

**Recovery:** Remove conditions through normal means (time, healing, magic) to resume harvesting

## Types of Materials

### Special Components (Tagged)
**What They Are:** Magical or enhanced creature features with power levels
**Tag Level:** Equals creature's Challenge Rating
**Examples:** Dragon fire glands [Fire 17], Owlbear claws [Sharp 7], Spider venom [Venom 3]
**Uses:** High-value crafting, magical enhancement, specialized applications

### Mundane Materials (Untagged)
**What They Are:** Basic biological materials for survival and trade
**No Power Level:** Simple functional materials
**Examples:** Meat, hide, bone, fat
**Uses:** Cooking, basic crafting, economic trade

---

## Time Requirements

### Special Components: Precision Extraction
**Time:** 10 minutes per component type (exploration activity)
**Process:** Careful extraction of specific organs or features
**Why Consistent:** Extracting a fire gland requires the same precision work regardless of creature size

### Mundane Materials: Bulk Processing
**Time:** Varies by creature size (camp activity)
- **Tiny:** 15 minutes
- **Small:** 20 minutes
- **Medium:** 30 minutes
- **Large:** 60 minutes
- **Huge:** 90 minutes
- **Gargantuan:** 180 minutes (3 hours)

**Process:** Volume-based work like butchering meat or processing hide

## Tools and Equipment

### Tool Requirements
**Without Proper Tools:** -2 circumstance penalty to all Harvest checks
**With Harvesting Tools:** No penalty (standard expectation)
**Quality Tools:** Item bonuses for expert and masterwork versions

### Harvesting Tools
**Contents:** Skinning knives, bone saws, extraction picks, cutting boards, collection containers, preservation salts, measuring tools, binding materials

**Tool Quality:**
- **Basic Harvesting Tools:** No penalty (2 gp, 2 Bulk)
- **Expert Harvesting Tools:** +1 item bonus (20 gp, 2 Bulk)
- **Master Harvesting Tools:** +2 item bonus (200 gp, 2 Bulk)
- **Legendary Harvesting Tools:** +3 item bonus (2,000 gp, 2 Bulk)

**Requirements:** Must be adjacent to creature, feature must be external type
**Skill Check:** Survival vs DC (14 + Tag Level + 2)
**No Tools Required:** Uses weapons and combat methods

### Combat Harvestable Features

- **[Fire]:** Internal breath organs
- **[Magical]:** Internal magical cores  
- **[Vital]:** Internal organs

### Combat Harvesting Results
**Critical Success:** Gain 1 component
**Success:** Gain 1 component
**Failure:** No component gained
**Critical Failure:** No component + creature makes opportunity attack against you

## Examples

### Standard Harvesting: Owlbear (CR 7)

**Special Components Available (10 minutes each):**
- **Claws [Sharp 7]:** DC 21 (simple extraction)
- **Enhanced Eyes [Sensory 7]:** DC 23 (moderate extraction)

**Mundane Materials Available (60 minutes total for Large creature):**
- **Hide, Meat, Bone:** DC 21 each, yields 2-3 bulk per type

**Strategy:** Extract valuable claws and eyes quickly (20 minutes), then decide if bulk processing is worth the additional hour

### Combat Example: Hindered Dragon

**Setup:** Dragon's wing was hindered during combat
**Opportunity:** Wing membrane [Flight] is now exposed and damaged
**Action:** Spend 2 actions on Combat Harvesting
**Check:** Survival vs DC 36 (14 + 20 + 2 for combat conditions)
**Risk:** If critical failure, dragon gets opportunity attack
**Reward:** Immediate [Flight 20] component worth significant value

## Quick Reference

### Basic Harvesting Checklist
1. **Identify creature's harvestable features**
2. **Choose component type to extract**
3. **Check if you have proper tools** (-2 penalty without)
4. **Roll Survival vs DC** (14 + Tag Level + Difficulty Modifier)
5. **Apply results and conditions**
6. **Repeat for other components** (if not blocked by conditions)

### Time Planning
- **Special components:** 10 minutes each
- **Mundane materials:** 15 minutes to 3 hours based on creature size
- **Combat harvesting:** 2 actions during combat

### Risk Management
- **Failure:** Temporary condition, can retry after recovery
- **Critical failure:** Component destroyed permanently + condition
- **Combat harvesting:** Risk opportunity attack on critical failure

**Remember:** Each component type is extracted separately, conditions block all harvesting until removed, and combat harvesting only works on external features that have been hindered this round.
